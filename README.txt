Hi there!

This is what your camper has been up to â€” we made a fun word game called Daily Speller using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS!

Daily Speller is a game inspired by Wordle. The goal is to guess the hidden 5-letter word in just 6 tries. After each guess, the game gives helpful hints:

ðŸŸ© Green means the letter is in the right spot.

ðŸŸ¨ Yellow means the letter is in the word but in the wrong spot.

â¬œ Gray means the letter isnâ€™t in the word at all.

We built everything from scratch using a code editor called Visual Studio Code (VS Code). The game board is created using code that responds to what the player types. That means the camper learned how to make websites interactive and dynamic!

This project helped us practice:

Writing real code in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Designing a user-friendly game interface

Problem solving and debugging

Thinking logically and creatively

Weâ€™re so proud of the work your camper did â€” coding a full game is no small task!

Thanks for supporting your camperâ€™s journey in tech!

 How to Run the Project in VS Code
If you'd like to see the game in action on your own computer, hereâ€™s how:

Install Visual Studio Code
Download and install VS Code from https://code.visualstudio.com.

Download the Project Files

If you received a zip file, unzip it to a folder on your computer.

Make sure the folder contains at least these files: index.html, style.css, and script.js.

Open the Project in VS Code

Open VS Code.

Click File > Open Folder and select the folder where you saved the project files.

Open the Game in Your Browser

In the file list (Explorer panel), right-click on WordleGame.html and choose "Open with Live Server".
Donâ€™t see that option? Install the Live Server extension in VS Code:

Go to the Extensions panel (left sidebar or press Ctrl+Shift+X).

Search for Live Server and click Install.

Once Live Server is running, the game will open in your default web browser!

Alternative: You can also open the WordleGame.html file directly by right-clicking it and selecting "Reveal in File Explorer", then double-clicking the file to open it in your browser.
